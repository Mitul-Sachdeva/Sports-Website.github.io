    <h1>Ballon d'Or</h1>
    <p>The <b>Ballon d'Or</b> is an annual football award presented by French news magazine France Football. 
    It has been awarded since 1956, although between 2010 and 2015, an agreement was made with FIFA, 
    and the award was temporarily merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year (founded in 1991) 
    and known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or. However, the partnership ended in 2016, and the award reverted 
    to the Ballon d'Or, while FIFA also reverted to its own separate annual award The Best FIFA Men's 
    Player. The recipients of the joint FIFA Ballon d'Or are considered as winners by both award 
    organisations.<br>
    Conceived by sports writer Gabriel Hanot, the Ballon d'Or award honours the male player deemed 
    to have performed the best over the previous year, based on voting by football journalists, from 
    1956 to 2006. After 2007, coaches and captains of national teams were also given the right to vote. 
    Originally, it was awarded only to players from Europe and widely known as the European Footballer 
    of the Year award. In 1995, the Ballon d'Or was expanded to include all players from any origin 
    that have been active at European clubs. The award became a global prize in 2007 with all 
    professional footballers from around the world being eligible.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p><b>Stanley Matthews</b> of England was the inaugural winner of the Ballon d'Or. Prior to 2007, the award 
    was generally known as the continental European Footballer of the Year award in English language 
    and much international media. Even after 2007, it was usually identified with and referred to by 
    that name because of its origin as a European award, until it was merged with FIFA's World Player 
    award cementing its new worldwide claim. Liberia's George Weah, the only African recipient, became 
    the first non-European to win the award in 1995, the year that rules of eligibility were changed 
    for the first time. Ronaldo of Brazil became the first South American winner two years later. 
    The second rule change in 2007 to include players from all continents did not bring up new winners, 
    as all recipients since then have still exclusively been active in Europe during their win.<br>
    <b>Lionel Messi</b> has won the award a record seven times, followed by Cristiano Ronaldo with five. 
    Three players have won the award three times each: Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van 
    Basten. With seven awards each, Dutch, German, Argentine and Portuguese players have won the most 
    Ballons d'Or. Players from Germany (1972, 1981) and the Netherlands (1988) were the only to take 
    all three top spots in one year, with German (1972) and especially Italian clubs (1988–1990) 
    achieving the same feat, including two years solely made up of AC Milan players (1988, 1989), a 
    unique record until Spanish clubs experienced an unforeseen dominance (2009–2012, 2015, 2016) 
    and Barcelona (2010) became the second club with three top players. Two Spanish clubs, Barcelona 
    and Real Madrid, also lead the ranking for employing the most winners, with twelve and eleven wins.<br>
    Eight players (Bobby Charlton, Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller, Paolo Rossi, Zinedine Zidane, 
    Rivaldo, Ronaldinho, and Kaká) have won the FIFA World Cup, the European Cup/UEFA Champions 
    League, and the Ballon d'Or during their careers.<br>
    In 2020, the Group L'Équipe, to which France Football belongs, decided that no award would be 
    given for the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic cutting short the seasons of football clubs 
    worldwide.</p>

    <h1>European Golden Shoe</h1>
    <p>The European Golden Shoe, also known as European Golden Boot, is an award that is presented 
    each season to the leading goalscorer in league matches from the top division of a European national 
    league. The trophy is a sculpture of a football boot. From its inception in the 1967–68 season, 
    the award, originally called "Soulier d'Or", which translates from French as Golden Shoe or Boot, 
    has been given to the top goalscorer in all European leagues during a season. Since 1997, it has 
    been calculated using a weighting in favour of the highest ranked leagues. Originally presented 
    by L'Équipe magazine, it has been awarded by the European Sports Media since the 1996–97 season. 
    Lionel Messi has won the award a record six times, all while playing for Barcelona.</p>
    <img src="LM_EURO_golden_shoe.jpg" alt="Lionel Messi wins 6th European golden shoe" width="450" height="350">
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Between 1968 and 1991, the award was given to the highest goalscorer in any European league. 
    This was regardless of the strength of the league in which the top scorer played and the number 
    of games in which the player had taken part. During this period Eusébio, Gerd Müller, Dudu 
    Georgescu and Fernando Gomes each won the Golden Shoe twice.<br>
    Following a protest from the Cyprus FA, which claimed that a Cypriot player with 40 goals should 
    have received the award (though the official top scorers for the season are both listed with 19 
    goals), L'Équipe issued no awards between 1991 and 1996.<br>
    Since the 1996–97 season, European Sports Media have awarded the Golden Shoe based on a points system 
    that allows players in tougher leagues to win even if they score fewer goals than a player in a 
    weaker league. The weightings are determined by the league's ranking on the UEFA coefficients, 
    which in turn depend on the results of each league's clubs in European competition over the previous 
    five seasons. Goals scored in the top five leagues according to the UEFA coefficients list are 
    multiplied by a factor of two, goals scored in the leagues ranked 6 to 22 (previously 9 to 21) 
    are multiplied by a factor of 1.5, and goals scored in leagues ranked 22 and below are multiplied 
    by a factor of 1. Thus, goals scored in higher ranked leagues will count for more than those 
    scored in weaker leagues. Since this change, there have only been two winners who were not 
    playing in one of the top five leagues (Henrik Larsson, 2000–01 Scottish Premier League and Mario 
    Jardel, 1998–99 Primeira Divisão and 2001–02 Primeira Liga).<br>
    Although the Golden Shoe could be shared among multiple players in the past, in the 2019–20 season 
    this rule was changed to give the award to the player with the least minutes played, should there 
    be a tie on points. If tie persists, number of league assists and, then, the less penalties scored, 
    would be counted. Only in case tie ultimately persists, the award would be shared.</p>

    <h1>The Best FIFA Men's Player</h1>
    <p>The Best FIFA Men's Player is an association football award presented annually by the sport's 
    governing body, FIFA, to the world's best men's player since 2016. The award was formerly known as 
    the FIFA World Player of the Year, which was merged with France Football's Ballon d'Or in 2010 to 
    become the FIFA Ballon d'Or in a six-year partnership.</p>
    <img src="RL_BEST.jpg" alt="Robert Lewandowski wins 2nd The BEST Award" width="400" height="300">
    <img src="CR-BEST.webp" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo wins 2nd the BEST Award" width="400" height="300">
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>In 2010, the FIFA World Player of the Year award combined with the Ballon d'Or to create the 
    FIFA Ballon d'Or in a six-year partnership. FIFA presided over the FIFA Ballon d'Or after agreeing 
    to pay £13million for the merge of the two major player awards with France Football. The six 
    editions of the FIFA Ballon d'Or were dominated by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of 
    their ongoing rivalry. In 2016, the Ballon d’Or again lost its ‘FIFA’ tag and would be voted for 
    exclusively by journalists, while the FIFA World Player of the Year award — which ran from 1991 
    to 2009 — was resurrected, this time as The Best FIFA Men's Player.<br>
    According to reports, FIFA's decision not to renew the deal was made in order to improve the 
    organization's strained relationship with England's FA. This was based on the fact the annual 
    ceremony was held in Zürich – and new FIFA president Gianni Infantino wanted to move the next one to London.<br>
    The trophy was designed by Croatian artist Ana Barbić Katičić.<br>
    The selection criteria for the players of the year are sporting performance, as well as general 
    conduct on and off the pitch. The votes are decided by media representatives, national team coaches, 
    and national team captains. In October 2016, it was announced that the general public would also 
    be allowed to vote. Each group has 25% of the overall vote.</p>

    <h1>FIFA World Player Of The Year</h1>
    <p>The FIFA World Player of the Year was an association football award presented annually by the 
    sport's governing body, FIFA, between 1991 and 2015. Coaches and captains of international teams 
    and media representatives selected the player they deem to have performed the best in the previous 
    calendar year.<br>
    Originally a single award for the world's best men's player, parallels awards for men and women 
    were awarded from 2001 to 2009. The men's award was subsumed into the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2010 
    while the women's award remained until 2015. After 2015 both men's and women's awards became part 
    of The Best FIFA Football Awards.<br>
    During the men's era, Brazilian players won 8 out of 19 years, compared to three wins – the second 
    most – for French players. In terms of individual players, Brazil again led with five, followed by 
    Italy and Portugal with two each. The youngest winner was Ronaldo, who won at 20 years old in 1996, 
    and the oldest winner was Fabio Cannavaro, who won aged 33 in 2006. Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane 
    each won the award three times, while Ronaldo and Ronaldinho were the only players to win in 
    successive years. From 2010 to 2015, the equivalent men's award was the FIFA Ballon d'Or, following 
    a merging of the FIFA World Player of the Year and the France Football Ballon d'Or awards. Since 
    2016, the awards have been replaced by The Best FIFA Men's Player and The Best FIFA Women's Player 
    awards.</p>
    <h2>Voting and Selection Process</h2>
    <p>The winners are chosen by the coaches and captains of national teams as well as by international 
    media representatives invited by FIFA. In a voting system based on positional voting, each voter is 
    allotted three votes, worth five points, three points and one point, and the three finalists are 
    ordered based on total number of points. Following criticism from some sections of the media over 
    nominations in previous years, FIFA has since 2004 provided shortlists from which its voters can 
    select their choices.</p>

    <h1>FIFA Puskás Award</h1>
    <p>The FIFA Puskás Award is an award established on 20 October 2009 by the Fédération Internationale 
    de Football Association (FIFA), at the behest of then-president Sepp Blatter, to be awarded to the 
    male or female judged to have scored the most aesthetically significant, or "most beautiful", goal 
    of the calendar year.<br>
    The award is in honour of Ferenc Puskás, the striker of Real Madrid during the late 1950s and the 
    1960s, and central member of the highly successful Hungarian side of the same era. Puskás is widely 
    considered by many to be the most powerful and prolific forward European football produced in 
    first-division football, and was honoured by IFFHS in 1997 as the best top-tier goalscorer of the 
    20th century. Puskás scored 511 goals in 533 games and his 84 national team's goals in 85 outings 
    was a world record at the time.<br>
    "It is important to preserve the memory of those footballing greats who have left their mark on 
    our history. Ferenc Puskás was not only a player with immense talent who won many honours, but 
    also a remarkable man. FIFA is therefore delighted to pay tribute to him by dedicating this award 
    to his memory," said Blatter at the inauguration of the award in Budapest.<br>
    Until 2018, the winner was decided completely based on voting by fans on FIFA's official website. 
    However, after a controversy in the 2018 award, FIFA changed the procedure. Now, the award is 
    decided by pundits selected by FIFA, who will choose the winner based on the top three goals voted 
    for by the public.<br>
    The time-frame for the first award was July 2008 to July 2009. The annual award was presented for 
    the first time during the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year Gala on 21 December in Switzerland, 
    with Portuguese player Cristiano Ronaldo being the first prize winner.</p>
    <img src="cristiano-ronaldo-5.webp" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo wins first FIFA Puskas Award" width="400" height="300">
    <h2>Award Criteria</h2>
    <p>1. It should be an absolutely beautiful goal (subjective, but decided by voting and judgement 
    from experts  — the spread of goals should include long-range shots, team goals, rabona, overhead 
    kicks, individual plays, scorpion kicks, etc.).<br>
    2. It should be awarded "without distinction of championship, gender or nationality".<br>
    3. It should not be the result of luck, mistakes, deflection by another player or the player 
    in an offside position.<br>
    4. It should support fair play, i.e. the player should not have behaved badly in the game or have 
    been charged with doping, for example.<br>
    5. The player cannot be nominated with two different goals.</p>
