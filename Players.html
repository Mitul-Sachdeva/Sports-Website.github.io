    <h1>George Best</h1>
    <p>George Best Born in Northern Ireland, George Best, was one of the finest and greatest players 
    of all time. He was equaled with Pele during his playing days. He debuted for Manchester United 
    club at 17. Speed, skill, and aggressive style of play were his attributes. However, his off-field 
    liaisons and lifestyle were too much for a club like Manchester United to accept. Hence, he was 
    dropped from the team and later injuries forced him to quit the game at a very early age of 27.
